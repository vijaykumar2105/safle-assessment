## Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step process to deploy the AWS infrastructure using Terraform, trigger the CI/CD pipeline, and set up monitoring and alerts. Additionally, it explains the design decisions and trade-offs involved in the infrastructure.

## Deployment Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    
    -   Install Terraform: Download Terraform
        
    -   Configure AWS CLI with credentials: `aws configure`
        
    -   Ensure you have sufficient IAM permissions to create resources such as VPCs, ECS clusters, RDS instances, and load balancers.
        
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_folder>
    ```
    
3.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    
    ```
    terraform init
    ```
    
4.  **Review the plan:**
    
    ```
    terraform plan
    ```
    
    -   Ensure the output matches your expectations. Any changes will be displayed here.
        
5.  **Apply the configuration:**
    
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    -   Confirm the execution by typing `yes` when prompted.
        
6.  **Outputs:**
    
    -   After successful deployment, Terraform will display outputs such as the load balancer DNS name and the database endpoint.
        

## Triggering the CI/CD Pipeline

1.  **Configure the CI/CD Pipeline:**
    
    -   Add your code repository to a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins).
        
    -   Use the `main` branch as the deployment trigger.
        
2.  **Modify the pipeline configuration file:**
    
    -   Ensure the configuration file (e.g., `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) includes steps to:
        
        -   Build and test the application.
            
        -   Push the container image to a registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
            
        -   Deploy the new image to the ECS service.
            
3.  **Trigger the pipeline:**
    
    -   Push a commit to the repository's main branch:
        
        ```
        git add .
        git commit -m "Trigger pipeline"
        git push origin main
        ```
        
    -   The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy your application.


## Setting Up Monitoring and Alerts

1.  **CloudWatch Metrics:**
    
    -   Enable AWS CloudWatch metrics for ECS, RDS, and the load balancer.
        
    -   Key metrics to monitor:
        
        -   ECS: CPU and memory utilization
            
        -   RDS: CPU, connections, and storage usage
            
        -   Load Balancer: Request count and latency
            
2.  **CloudWatch Alarms:**
    
    -   Set up alarms for critical metrics. For example:
        
        -   ECS CPU Utilization > 75%
            
        -   RDS Connections > 80% of the limit
            
        -   Load Balancer 5xx Errors > 10
            
3.  **Notification Configuration:**
    
    -   Use AWS SNS to send notifications when alarms are triggered.
        
    -   Subscribe email or SMS endpoints to the SNS topic.
        
4.  **Third-party Monitoring Tools:**
    
    -   Integrate tools like Datadog or New Relic for advanced monitoring and dashboards.    
        

## Design Decisions and Trade-offs

1.  **VPC Design:**
    
    -   A single VPC with public and private subnets ensures secure isolation of resources while allowing external access via the load balancer.
        
2.  **Fargate for ECS:**
    
    -   Chosen for its serverless nature, eliminating the need to manage EC2 instances.
        
    -   Trade-off: Slightly higher costs compared to EC2-based ECS clusters.
        
3.  **Auto-scaling:**
    
    -   Auto-scaling ensures the system can handle traffic spikes efficiently.
        
    -   Trade-off: Requires careful tuning of thresholds to avoid unnecessary scaling events.
        
4.  **Managed Database (RDS):**
    
    -   Simplifies database management with automated backups and patching.
        
    -   Trade-off: Limited control over database configurations compared to self-managed databases.
        
5.  **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    
    -   CloudWatch provides native integration with AWS services for efficient monitoring.
        
    -   Trade-off: Advanced analytics require third-party tools or custom solutions.
        

## Architectural Diagram

Below is an architectural diagram illustrating the interaction between components:

```
                    +---------------------+
                    |      Clients        |
                    +---------+-----------+
                              |
                              v
                    +---------------------+
                    |  Application Load   |
                    |      Balancer       |
                    +---------+-----------+
                              |
                    +---------------------+
                    |      Public         |
                    |      Subnets        |
                    +---------+-----------+
                              |
               +--------------+--------------+
               |                             |
+-------------------------+     +-------------------------+
|   ECS Fargate Service   |     |       RDS Instance      |
|   (Web Application)     |     |   (Managed Database)    |
+-------------------------+     +-------------------------+
```

The public subnets host the application load balancer, while the private subnets host the ECS services and the RDS database for improved security.

## Deploying application locally

- building the docker image
```
docker build -t <imagename> .
```

- Once the build is completed. Run the container locally.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Open the browser and hit the URL http://localhost:8000/
